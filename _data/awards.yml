        Congratulations to @redbullgaming for RBW: El Reinado coming home as the best S-tier with their LAN in Spain back in October.
        This proved to be the best tournament of the year, but only just! It pipped NAC V by ONE vote only so also very big congratulations to @Nili_AoE and all the organisers of NAC V doing a stellar job.

        Up next is best A-tier! This won't come as a huge surprise, and this tournament absolutely ran away with the voting, securing more than half.

        Wandering Warriors Cup returned for it's second edition after a break of a few years and really proved to be a hit with the AoE community with it's transport and nomadic style maps (even Houseboat). 

        Well done to @T90Official and @Dave_AoE  for bringing it back and the organisers for doing a great job.

        Wandering Warriors Cup 2, your best A-tier tournament for 2024.
