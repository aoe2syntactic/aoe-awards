      Congratulations to @redbullgaming for RBW: El Reinado coming home as the best S-tier with their LAN in Spain back in October.
      This proved to be the best tournament of the year, but only just! It pipped NAC V by ONE vote only so also very big congratulations to @Nili_AoE and all the organisers of NAC V doing a stellar job.
  - name: "Best A-Tier tournament"
    winner: "Wandering Warriors Cup 2"

      This won't come as a huge surprise, and this tournament absolutely ran away with the voting, securing more than half.

      Wandering Warriors Cup returned for it's second edition after a break of a few years and really proved to be a hit with the AoE community with it's transport and nomadic style maps (even Houseboat). 

      Well done to @T90Official and @Dave_AoE  for bringing it back and the organisers for doing a great job.

      Wandering Warriors Cup 2, your best A-tier tournament for 2024.
  - name: "Best B-Tier tournament"
    winner: "Town Center Tango"
    image: best-b-tier.jpg
    description: >
      This goes to Town Center Tango! A 3v3 Sudden Death team game event with $1500 prizepool. Personally I think TCT got very good value with lots of eyes on the tournament with high level teams signing up because it was great stream content first and foremost. The games were good fun to watch and really something for smaller tournament organisers to emulate with their own tournaments.

      Great job by Jammin and the organisers!
  - name: "Best C-Tier tournament"
    winner: "Stronghold Frenzy"
    image: best-c-tier.jpg
    description: >
      Hosted by UnknownPlayer and Marintho, Stronghold Frenzy is your favourite C-tier tournament from 2024. Featuring some fun and new clown adjacent maps and many of the top clowns participating. AntagonisT from SalzZ ended up winning it all.

      Would love to see another edition in the future!
  - name: "Best series"
    winner: "RBW Semis: TheViper vs Liereyy"
    image: best-series.jpg
    description: >
      Next award is for Best Series, which is quite a well contested one for this edition. This pairing had some great games in more than one tournament against each other, but the series during El Reinado semi-finals proved to be the best of the best in 2024. 

      Well done TheViper and Liereyy! TheViper emerged victorious in this contest, but what will happen moving forward? The community is hoping to see more great games in 2025.
  - name: "Best new map"
    winner: Evacuation by HenkDeSuperNerd
    image: best-map.jpg
    description: >
      Now, I'm sure there are plenty of people that thought 'Stranded' from WWC2 was a new map. Let me clear this up... well, it isn't. If you voted for it, your vote didn't count for anything. Do your research kids. 

      Anyway, back to the winner... Producing a lot of great games in Hidden Cup V hosted by T90Official, some of these went super far in game... especially when ACCM dueled on the map.

      Evacuation by HenkDeSuperNerd is your Best New Map for 2024. It's really difficult to create new maps and also combine different map designs within one map that flow and interact very well together and Henk did a stellar job on this one. Very well deserved if I say so myself. Amazing job, Henk.

      T-West is your map scripter of the year who works tirelessly in tournaments always constantly trying to improve maps for the tournament so that they are more fair, competitive and all round better.

      For people that you think do a fantastic job in providing amazing content to the AoE community in the most creative fashion. This can include streamers, YouTube editors, musicians, X (formerly known as twitter) accounts, podcasters etc.

      There could have been many people worthy of winning this one, but the people have spoken.

      The Amigo, the Pole, another one of the Bald Alliance... very well done to Barles for his fantastically crafted meme and hilarious YouTube videos.

      Not everyone is lucky enough to win TWO awards, but Rbase96 also walks with the Unsung Hero award on top of his Tournament Contributor of the Year.   

      The Unsung Hero award '...will be for outstanding work in the community. It can be for individuals that provide tools, admins, graphics etc.'  

      Once again, there were so many different people deserving of this which was reflected in the voting. I'd like to give a few of them a shout out for all their work and let them know that it's very much appreciated by the community, but once again a very well deserved recognition for Rbase.  

      Thanks Rbase for the new photo!

      Most Improved Caster of the Year for 2024 goes to...

      @TravisWestura aka T-West. Making his LAN event debut just recently at the Noble Apartment Cup, it's been a great year for T-West who continues to leave a massive impact on the community in many different ways, but his casting is getting the recognition it also deserves.

      Seriously, well played sir.

      Onwards and upwards even more.

      Well done, T-West.
  - name: "Caster of the year"
    winner: Dave

      Our last 3 awards for 2024...

      One of the big ones, Caster of the Year goes to @Dave_AoE!

      Battling through health issues in recent months, Dave still made multiple journeys across to Europe  for LAN events and performed at the same level that we have all grown accustomed to in recent years. 

      One of the very best in the business for adapting to whoever else he is co-casting with and one of the most personable streamers we have in the community.  If you like behaving like an educated degenerate, his stream is the place for you.

      Congratulations, Dave!
