      The vote was hotly contested, but we did come out with a very worthy champion.
      His maps are a main stay in S tier tournaments such as, Frigid Lake, Haboob, Desert Void, Morass, Rocky Forest, Shoals and countless more.

      He also happens to be the individual you want to congratulate/blame for current Arabia.
      Turns out, he is also a pretty decent player, with some of the best monk micro in the game. Big congratulations to our favourite Dane...

      I won't do this for all posts, but some do deserve honourable mentions.

      With that being said, we did find an extremely worthy winner for 2023.
      One of those people that you just love to have in your ears... Nice one, bruv!

      We really have so many individuals worthy of highlighting here that really provide such terrific value to the competitive community.

      Our winner though, hosted two S tier tournaments this year (one just about broke me in half this year) and casted countless amount of others throughout the year.
      Congratulations to MembTV.

    description: >
      There won't be too many people receiving two awards tonight, but in my opinion this one is very well deserved after a very consistent year when it came to their casting.
      Covering a ton of TTL and Nations Cup earlier in the year and has been very consistent ever since.

      Very well done and congratulations on your second award, T-West.

      Canada vs China - Nations Cup Grand Final (3rd)

    description: >
      We had a lot of different votes for this one, but one particular ran away with it and ended up with a large portion of the votes despite the huge amount of non S-tier tournaments we have had this year.

      Our winner might not have been S-Tier, but it did feel like it.
      Won by the classic duo of TheViper and JorDan.
      
      The winner is...The Cartographers, Best non S-Tier Tournament for 2023!
      Hosted by The Viper and additional work by T-West, OrnLu and Lord Patito.

  - name: "Comeback Player of the Year"
    intro: >
      'Comeback player' is not all that easy to define so there will be some interpretation to what you define as a 'comeback player.'
      For the purposes of the awards it should be players that you considered inactive, inactive in tournaments or even underperforming in tournaments in previous years.
    winner: Hearttt
    image: comeback-player.png
    description: >
      This one was a complete and utter landslide and there can be no debate that this player has had a great resurgence in their AoE career after being around for quite a number of years now.
      Recently qualified for NAC V, let's see what is next...

      Huge congrats to Hearttt, Comeback Player of the Year for 2023!

      Another very dominant victory in this category with this player rising to prominence this year performing for Team Austria in Nations Cup, a huge breakout in TTL, making the main event stage of Warlords II and just recently qualifying for the NAC V main event due to take place in 2024.
      What's in store for next? How high can they go?

      There isn't going to be much debate over this, because this player has been utterly dominant this year. Winning just about everything he enters in 1v1 and very impressive performances in team game events too.

      A very, very well done to Hera, Player of the Year 2023
